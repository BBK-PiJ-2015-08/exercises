2. In this question we examine the Singleton design pattern.
(a) Why might you decide to lazy-initialise a singleton instance rather than initialise
it in its field declaration? Provide code examples of both approaches to illustrate
your answer.
You might decide to lazy-initialise a singleton instance so that if the instance isnâ€™t needed, it is never going to be created.
Example of lazy instantiation:
public static Singleton getInstance() {
	if (firstInstance == null) {
		firstInstance = new Singleton();
	}
}

Example of eager instantiation:
private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
public static Singleton getInstance() {
	return instance;
}

1a) Briefly describe the Strategy Design Pattern
The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm used vary independently from clients that use it.

1b) When is it appropriate to use the Strategy Design Pattern?
It is appropriate to use the Strategy pattern when you want to define a class that will have one behaviour that is similar to all the other behaviours in a list.
You want a class object to be able to choose from one of several different algorithms.

3) When is it appropriate to use the Abstract Factory Design Pattern?
You should use the Abstract Factory pattern to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. This is helpful when you have many objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during runtime.

5. “In general, the details of object construction, such as instantiating and initialising the components that comprise the object, are kept within the object, often as part of its constructor.”
Comment on this statement with reference to modularity and construction bloat.
